    <updated>2024-05-31T06:18:40.274823+00:00</updated>
    <content>Reinvest24 is raising funds from "a limited group of verified investors, who have a serious interest in Reinvest24 succeeding with the legal recovery". Many concerned investors are questioning Reinvest24's intentions, given the platform is not replying to emails and is delaying withdrawals for up to 40 days. Since Reinvest24 is not regulated in Estonia, it's questionable whether the company can raise further funds from retail investors. Reinvest24 has not given enough information about the legal action or the portfolio performance in Spain. Any further investments on this platform are connected with extreme risk.</content>

    <content>Reinvest24 is raising funds from "a limited group of verified investors, who have a serious interest in Reinvest24 succeeding with the legal recovery". Many concerned investors are questioning Reinvest24's intentions, given the platform is not replying to emails and is delaying withdrawals for up to 40 days. Since Reinvest24 is not regulated in Estonia, it's questionable whether the company can raise further funds from retail investors. Reinvest24 has not given enough information about the legal action or the portfolio performance in Spain. Any further investments on this platform are connected with extreme risk.</content>
