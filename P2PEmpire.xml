    <updated>2025-03-04T01:16:32.275352+00:00</updated>
    <content>A TWINO investor recently fell victim to a fraud scheme in which a scammer gained access to the investor's account. The fraudster changed the email address, sold investments on the secondary market, and then used the stolen identity to open a bank account and clear the investment account. This incident is a reminder that such attacks are not uncommon in the P2P lending industry. We strongly urge all investors to activate two-factor authentication (2FA) and remain vigilant in monitoring their online activities.</content>

    <title>Important Update on Inactive Account Fees</title>
    <updated>2025-03-04T01:16:32.273731+00:00</updated>
    <content>The inactive account fee is applied if the investor has not made any new investments within a 12-month period. €10 is applied once the account has been inactive for 12 months and €50 is applied when the period is respectively 24 months. Prior to any fees being deducted, investors will be informed via email that a fee will be applied, and prior to the fees being deducted, investors will have the ability to withdraw their available balance free of charge to avoid the fee from being deducted. The fee will not be deducted from accounts that have either made a small investment or withdrawn their available funds; nobody’s account will be drawn into minus, and nobody will receive an invoice. Therefore, if investors are keen on being idle and withdrawing their funds, then this fee encourages them to do it free of charge.</content>

    <content>Reinvest24 is raising funds from "a limited group of verified investors, who have a serious interest in Reinvest24 succeeding with the legal recovery". Many concerned investors are questioning Reinvest24's intentions, given the platform is not replying to emails and is delaying withdrawals for up to 40 days. Since Reinvest24 is not regulated in Estonia, it's questionable whether the company can raise further funds from retail investors. Reinvest24 has not given enough information about the legal action or the portfolio performance in Spain. Any further investments on this platform are connected with extreme risk.</content>

    <updated>2025-03-04T01:16:32.261549+00:00</updated>
    <content>Reinvest24 is raising funds from "a limited group of verified investors, who have a serious interest in Reinvest24 succeeding with the legal recovery". Many concerned investors are questioning Reinvest24's intentions, given the platform is not replying to emails and is delaying withdrawals for up to 40 days. Since Reinvest24 is not regulated in Estonia, it's questionable whether the company can raise further funds from retail investors. Reinvest24 has not given enough information about the legal action or the portfolio performance in Spain. Any further investments on this platform are connected with extreme risk.</content>

    <title>Crowdpear reports another default</title>
    <updated>2025-03-04T01:16:32.259061+00:00</updated>
    <content>Crowdpear has terminated its contract with UAB "Sondvitus," which had borrowed money for the development of the "Azalijų 1" project. Due to a dispute between the borrower and its business partner, the court has initiated insolvency proceedings.

While investors receive an additional 5% annual interest for each day of delay, under the Law on Insolvency of Legal Entities of the Republic of Lithuania, interest on investments in the "Azalijų 1" project loans will no longer accumulate from the date of the court's decision regarding UAB "Sondvitus"'s insolvency case, effective from July 25th of this year.

Crowdpear is confident that the project's low Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 53% will enable the company to recover all of the investors' funds.</content>
