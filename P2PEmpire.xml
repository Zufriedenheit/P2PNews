    <title>PeerBerry will stop offering loans from Poland</title>
    <updated>2023-11-06T12:25:32.378791+00:00</updated>
    <content>The platform announced that it will stop the listing of loans from Poland from January 1, 2024, due to the regulatory change that probits lenders to fund their portfolios via P2P investors. To ensure sufficient loan supply, PeerBerry will offer investments in new lenders via a business loan. As the Polish loans represent 17% of the AUM, it might take up to Q2 2024 to replace the current loan supply.</content>
